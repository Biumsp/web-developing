    <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>* : universal selector</li>
        <li>element selector: selects all elements of a given type. Uses the html elements</li>
        <li>You can use a comma as an "or" between to selectors</li>
        <li>ID selectors: we can associate an ID (as an argument) to any element. To provide a hook for css to single
            out a single element. You should have only one object for any ID
            You wanna use as little ID as possible. Classes are better </li>
        <li>class selector. A class is like an ID for multiple elements.
            For example you can tag alla spans with a certain class.
            It makes sense to give the parent elements classes and use the descendant selector to select things inside
            of them.
        </li>
        <li>descendant selectors: a <b>space</b>. A space means that the second element i nested inside of the first
        </li>
        <li>adjacent combinator: the + is used to select elements on the same level, one after the other. Like
            h2 + button</li>
        <li>Direct descendant combinator: > is used to select an element that is directly nested inside of another. For
            example li > a selects all anchor tags inside of a point-of-list element</li>
        <li>Attribute selectors: allows us to select elements with a certain attribute set to a specific value.
            It works like this: element[attribute="value"]
            And you can use also fuzzier matches: with *= instead of the equal sign you get all the elements that have a
            value for that element that contains the value we give.
            Look at the MDN page.
        </li>
        <li>pseudo classes: they identify a state of an element. They all start with a column.
            For example a:hover selects anchor tags that are being hovered over.
            <ul>
                <li>:hover</li>
                <li>:active, for something that is currently being activated (a button that is clicked and held.</li>
                <li>:checked</li>
                <li>:n-th-of-type(mn), m is a number. n has to stay as letter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>pseudo-elements. You define them wit :: <br>
            They select a particular part of an element
            <ul>
                <li>::first-letter</li>
                <li>::first-line</li>
                <li>::selection applies to highlighted parts of elements</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        We can already see it doesn' work for some elements.
        It has to do with specificity.
