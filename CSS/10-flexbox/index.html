    <h1>Let's Play With Flexbox</h1>

    <p>
        It it an ensamble of tools used to layout elements. First of all there is he property display, and we can set it
        to flex, to activate the flexbox model.
        When we enable the flexbox model we get a main axis, along which our elements flow. The default is an
        horizontal, left-to-right axis. But we can change it using flex-direction:, with values row, row-reverse,
        column, column-reverse.

        Another important property is justify-content:, the default being left-start (when the main axis goes from left
        to right). Or flex-end, center, space-between (distributes the excess space between the elements, but not
        between them and the container), space-around (gives each element the same space around), space-evenly (ensures
        that the space is evenly distributed between elements and elements-container).

        Another property is flex-wrap:, with values wrap or wrap-reverse. If set, when elements are bigger than the
        container, instead of being squashed, they are spread along the cross axis (the one that is not the main axis),
        in a new column or row. Wrap and wrap reverse determine the direction of the cross-axis. The default value is
        flex-wrap: nowrap;

        Justify-content was to distribute space along the main axis. Now we have to distribute space along the
        cross-axis. It is align-items: <br>
        It has flex-start (alligns to the start of the cross-axis), flex-end, center (at the center of the cross axis),
        baseline (aligned to the baseline of the inner text (the baseline is the line through the bottom of each
        letter)).

        Align-content is to distribute space between the elements, along the cross axis. If we are in flex-direction:
        column; and we have flex-wrap set, we will get many columns if our items overflow. Those columns are divided by
        some space. This space disposition is determined by the value of align-content. With values space-between,
        center, space-around...

        In the flex container we can also apply a property to a single element: align-self. It has the same values, but
        we set it for a single element.
