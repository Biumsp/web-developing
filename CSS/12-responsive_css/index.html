    <h1>Responsive Design</h1>

    <p>It is about making a website responsive to different screen sizes or different features of screen and devices.
    </p>
    <p>We do it using media queries: they allow us to modify our style depending on some parameters, like screen width,
        or portrait/landscape-mode. It is not just about scaling things, but also about changing the layout.</p>
    <p>Using the dev-tools of chrome you can also view the page as if it was displayed at a different screen-size
        They are very well described <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media">here</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Media queries begin with "@media", folloewd by a criterion "(parameter: value)" like (min-width: 400px), or
        (orientation: landscape)
    </p>
