    <h1>Flex Sizing Properties</h1>
    <p>
        Flex sizing properties are used to make the elements adapt to the available space around them. We look at three
        properties for individual items in a flex container: <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            flex-basis: the initial size, before is added into are self container. It is the initial size along the
            main-axis
        </li>
        <li>
            flex-grow: distributes the available space between the elements with this property set. They grow and get to
            occupy a portion of the available space that is given by the fraction of their value, divided by the sum of
            the values of all the elements. I.e., if you give one element flex-grow: 1; and the other flex-grow: 2; the
            second one will eat up twice as much the space of first one. If flex-wrap is enabled, this happens at every
            new line/column. We can set a max-width.
        </li>
        <li>
            flex-shrink: it's the same. It determines how much elements shrink when there is'n enough space.
            Just like flex-grow, the default value is 1. We can set a min-width to avoid that it shrinks over a certain
            point.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a shorthand: flex. This property allows to set all three values at once. In order they are flex-grow,
        flex-shrink, flex-basis.
    </p>
