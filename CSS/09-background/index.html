        <h1>Background property</h1>
        <p>
            Just like other properties, like margin, backgound is a keyword for many properties:
            We can set a background color, or an image.
            You can find images on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>.

            You can use background as a single property with a list of arguments, instead of all the single properties.
            The order of the arguments doesn't matter, with one exception: if you specify the backrground-size property
            and the background-position property, the must be specified like this: position_value/size_value. Like,
            center/cover or bottom/80%.
            If our image doesn't cover all the element (for example if we set its size to 20% and set no-repeat), we can
            set a second background.
