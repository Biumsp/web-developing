    <h1>Box Model</h1>
    <p>Inner content area</p>
    <p>Padding</p>
    <p>Border</p>
    <p>Margin</p>

    <p id="wh">We can change the width and height of the inner content area: the content box.</p>

    <h2>Border and border-related properties</h2>
    <div id="one">
        The border is the border around an element.
        The main properties are:
        <ul>
            <li>border-width</li>
            <li>border-color</li>
            <li>border-style</li>
        </ul>
        They HAVE to be ALL set. Otherwise you don't see anything.
    </div>
    <p id="two">This is the second one: you can style individually the sides of the border.</p>
    <p id="three">
        This is the third one. You can use one single property ("border") to select the width, style and color all at
        once.
    </p>

    <p id="four">
        We usually give border width with px because they are very thin and don't change with the page zoom.
        The border width is added to the content area's. To change that we have to set <br>
        box-sizing: border-box; Doing so, will make width select the overall width: content+border.
    </p>

    <h1>Padding</h1>
    <p>
        The space between the content and the border. Like border, we have the shorthand "padding" for all the sides at
        once
    </p>

    <h2>Margin</h2>
    <p>It's the space outsde of the border. The
        body element has some default margin, just as all h1s. It is pretty common to set body {margin: 0;}, to avoid
        this default margin.
        Using margin: auto; makes it s.t. the content is centered inside its container.
