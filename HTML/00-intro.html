    <h1>What is HTML?</h1>

    <div>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        HTML is a "markup language". It provides informations about
        the text, s.t. "this is a button" or "this should be bold"
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>HTML Elements</h2>
        <p>We perform this markup using markup elements
            Using those we can make things <b>bold</b>, or <i>italicized</i>, or <u>underlined</u>...
            More in general we can wrap text in tags, that give them formatting, or a class... in general,
            they will attach some meta-informations to the text
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Some Elements</h2>
        <p>Paragraphs split out content in sections, that start in different lines</p>
        <p>Headings (h1 to h6) are usually ranked by importance, to define headings, sub-headings...
            They should not be used for the size, but just for conceptual purpose, to give structure.
            We should always use <b>a single h1</b> at most.
            Headings take up a whole line.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
        <p>In VS Code we can write some lorem ipsum just by
            writing "lorem" and hitting TAB.

            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit. Ducimus sequi reprehenderit, corporis quisquam
            odit maxime eaque veritatis pariatur consequatur modi ratione molestiae, quasi natus, quos cum est?
            Temporibus, facere voluptate?
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Resources</h2>
        <p>We can find <b>a lot</b> of useful resources on <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN</a></p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Chrome Inspector</h2>
        <p>This is a tool of utmost importance. It is the way to inspect
            the code producing a webpage.
            To open it you just right-click on anything in a webpage (in Chrome) and
            select "inspect".
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>HTML document structure</h2>
        <p>
            Every HTML document <b>must</b> have a fixed structure.
            We have to set the DOCTYPE (is an only-open tag).
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, we have to create the html element, which
            contains the whole document.</p>
        <p>
            Inside the html element we have the head: it contains the metadata about the document (css files' paths,
            fonts...).
        </p>
        <p>
            The title element: it changes the title on the card displayed in the browsers, and it is what search engines
            look for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, we have a body element: in contains all the content (all of the buttons,
            all the navigation bars, all the sections...)
        </p>
        <h3>Shortcut in VS Code</h3>
        <p>A shortcut for all of this boilerplate comes with VS Code: just type an exclamation point and hit TAB</p>

    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>
            You can create unordered lists:
        <ul>
            <li>First element</li>
            <li>Second element</li>
            <li>Third element</li>
        </ul>

        And ordered lists:
        <ol>
            <li>First element</li>
            <li>Second element</li>
            <li>Third element</li>
        </ol>

        And inside the points of the list you can
        nest a list, or make things bold...
        <ul>
            <li>First class
                <ul>
                    <li>1.1 element</li>
                    <li>1.2 element</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Second class
                <ul>
                    <li>2.1 element</li>
                    <li>2.2 element</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h2>Anchor tag</h2>
        <p>
            We can insert hyperlinks using the anchor tag, like
            <a href="https://www.google.com">this</a>.
            They need an attribute, href, that tells where to go.
        </p>
        <p>
            So yes, elements can have attributes.
            Inside the attribute we need to specify "http" or "https", to tell it to use the http protocol.
            When reading, we are using the file protocol, not http protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            We can also link one page to <a href="01-semantics.html">another</a>, inside my local file system.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- I can include comments -->
    <!-- In VS Code is ctrl+k+c to comment and ctrl+k+u to uncomment -->
    <div>
        <h2>Images</h2>
        <p>
            It does not have an opening <b>and</b> closing tag. We only have one tag.
            We just provide a location for the image.
            It has an attribute src, with the location.
        </p>
        <img src="https://www.thermal-engineering.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Navier-Stokes-Equations-definition.png"
            alt="Just an image">
        <p>
            Another very important attribute of img is "alt". It contains
            a description of the image, for accessibility and screen readers.
            It is also what is displayed if the image is not available.
        </p>
        <p>
            The width and height of th images should be controlled using CSS.
        </p>
    </div>
</body>
