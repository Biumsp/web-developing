    <p>
        There are block-level elements and inline elements. But we can change their behavior using the "display"
        property.
        Inline and block elements have different behavior in terms of box-model properties.
        <span id="Inline">Inline elements cannot force vertical properties</span>,
        like margin and patting in top and bottom sides.
        On the other hand, block elements can enforce all properties they like on the surrounding elements.
    </p>
    <p>We have another option: inline-block.
        This is going to behave like an inline element, except, width, height, padding, margin are going to be
        respected.
    </p>

    <div></div>
    <div></div>
    <div></div>

    <p>Display can also be set to none, s.t. you can hide and unhide elements</p>
