    <h1>Cascade and Specificity</h1>

    <h2>Order matters</h2>
    <p>
        In our css files, order matters. Also, if I link more style-sheets, the order I include them matters.
    </p>

    <h2>Specificity</h2>
    <p>
        What happens when you have more selectors selecting the same object?
        Which one wins? When I have a conflict the most specific wins. And there is an actual formula for that: <br>
        <b>ID > CLASS > ELEMENT</b>
        IDs count like infinite to the second, classes like inf to the first, elements like infinite to the zero.
        Anyway you can use a <a href="https://specificity.keegan.st/"> specificity calculator</a>.
        pseudoclasses count as classes, pseudoelements count as elements.
        This applies only when we have a conflict: if different properties are set in different blocks, no conflict
        arises and they are all applied.
    </p>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>
        Some css properties will be inherited by child elements, if not set specifically.
        Certain elements don't inherit by default.
    </p>
